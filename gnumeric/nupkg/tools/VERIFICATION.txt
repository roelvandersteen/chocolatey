VERIFICATION

Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and
community in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.


EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

Gnumeric for Windows is no longer publicly available. The package is
unlisted on chocolatey.org and it will remain like that. For those who
want to install Gnumeric anyway, the installer can be downloaded from
this URL:

https://web.archive.org/web/20140702003750if_/https://people.gnome.org/~mortenw/gnumeric/gnumeric-1.12.17-20140610.exe

Since `Get-ChocolateyWebFile` is unable to download the installer from
its original (archived) location, the EXE is downloaded manually and
included in the choco package. The checksum is identical to that of the
file at the above URL.
