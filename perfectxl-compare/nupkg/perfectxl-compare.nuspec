    <summary>PerfectXL Compare for Spreadsheet Comparison</summary>
    <description>The PerfectXL Excel compare tool is user friendly, easy to understand, and will quickly become an unmissable part of your work with Excel. It was designed in collaboration with a large set of varying Excel users, experts, beginners, and users in major financial institutions.

The program compares two Excel sheets for differences between the two versions and provides users a detailed overview of findings. It tracks differences back to user actions, reporting only true changes.

The speed, accuracy, and completeness are largely due to a fundamental spreadsheet comparison research done by the TU Delft. The user friendly interface is based on user tests and best practices.

This software is only available in a 64-bits version.</description>
